For this project, all members have played an active role and contributed to all aspects of the project. Whether it be by tossing around ideas with each other to move forward with code and design, or by doing actual coding to build the structure of the game. Whenever someone has been stuck on something, we have all been there to support each other in order to move forward. 

Samuel and Jonas have focused heavily on the backend of the project. While Jonas set up the base structure for the project, Samuel made sure that the right types were set up in the code as we decided to to move forward using Typescript. Together, they worked on setting up socket servers so that in-game communication worked. They also worked a lot on the game mechanics and the gameplay, making sure that the game logic was there so that the game was playable and understandable. 

Edvin and Isabella focused on the project's frontend, on everything from UI to UX. They made sure that the interface has a nice design, that made the game attractive to users as well as making sure that the UX is clear, and that someone who has never played it before understands how to move forward. Edvin laid the groundwork for a lot of the menus in the game, whereas Isabella focused on designing the settings in the lobby to work and making sure that the settings were functional. Together they also styled their own components for the game that can be reusable in different views.
